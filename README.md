## How to Contribute

### Opening a Pull Request

#### First step

You can add a .svg file in the `/src/assets/logo`  directory as the logo of the ecosystem you want to add. This file should be less than 1M.

#### Second step

You can add a .jpeg file or a .png file in the `/src/assets/banner`  directory as the banner of the ecosystem you want to add. The size of the picture should be 1500*500, if not correct may affect the final display effect.

#### Third step

You can add a .json file in the `/src/jsonList`  directory as the main body of the ecosystem you want to add. File configuration is as follows (we use Arbitrum as an example)ï¼š

```bash
