## How to Contribute

### Opening a Pull Request

#### First step

You can add an .svg file for the logo of the ecosystem you want to add in the `/src/assets/logo` directory. This file should be smaller than 1MB.

#### Second step

You can add a .jpeg or .png file for the banner of the ecosystem you want to add in the `/src/assets/banner` directory. The image should be sized at 1500px*500px; deviations from this size may affect the final display.

#### Third step

```bash
